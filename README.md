REMEMBER TO EXTRACT THE .ZIP-PACKAGE BEFORE CONTINUING!

This script removes some bloatware included with fresh Windows 10 installations.

The script will ask for your confirmation when uninstalling Calculator and Voice recorder 
because some people might want to keep using them.

1. Open powershelladmin.reg - this adds "Run with PowerShell (Admin)" to your context menu
	Click "YES" in the UAC prompt and then "YES" and "OK" in the registry editor windows.
2. Right click on remotesigned.ps1 and select "Run with PowerShell (Admin)" from the context menu - this 
allows you to run PowerShell scripts which originate from external sources.
	Click "YES" in the UAC prompt and then press ENTER when the blue PowerShell window tells you so.
3. Right click on removebloat.ps1 and select "Run with PowerShell (Admin)" from the context menu 
	Click "YES" in the UAC prompt. Wait for the program to uninstall the software and then examine any errors if any may occur. 
	If everything is all right, press ENTER. 
- this will start the uninstallation of the programs and services listed below.  You will be prompted on Calculator and Voice Recorder
